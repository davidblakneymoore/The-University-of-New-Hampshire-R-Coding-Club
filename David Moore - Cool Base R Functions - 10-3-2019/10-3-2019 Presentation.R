# The 'with' function makes it so that you don't have to
# keep typing out the data frame name every time you want
# to use a column from that data frame:

# We know these work:

lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl * mtcars$wt)
lm(mpg ~ cyl * wt, data = mtcars)

with(mtcars, lm(mpg ~ wt * cyl))

# 'interaction.plot' can be used to investigate interactions:

# we're still going to check it out (just for fun).

# Here's a practical example of why you might
# want to use the above functions:

# You have columns 'response_1', 'response_2,
# 'response_3', etc., up to 'response_15'

(Column_Names <- paste("response", 1:15, sep = "_"))

# These responses occur in groups of 3:
# responses 1 through 3 were measured from
# tree 1, responses 4 through 6 were measured
# from tree 2, etc.

Number_of_Responses_per_Tree <- 3

# We want to add tree number to the column names.

# First, let's extract the response numbers:

(Response_Numbers <- as.numeric(gsub("response_", "", Column_Names)))

# To generate tree numbers, we'll use the '%/%
# function as above:

Response_Numbers %/% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree

# It looks like we're off a little - we should start
# with 3 consecutive ones and end with three consecutive
# fives. So, let's try doing the same thing, but we'll
# start with 'Response_Numbers + 2' instead of
# 'Response_Numbers':

(Response_Numbers + 2) %/% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree

# That seemed to work. Let's save that output as an object.

Tree_Numbers <- (Response_Numbers + 2) %/% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree

(New_Column_Names <- paste(Column_Names, "tree", Tree_Numbers, sep = "_"))

# We also want to add tree height in. The first measurement
# from each tree was taken at the base, the second was taken
# from a height of 5 m, and the third was taken in the
# canopy.

# We can use the '%%' function to help with this:

Response_Numbers %% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree

# Again, we're off a little.

(Response_Numbers - 1) %% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree

# One more step....

((Response_Numbers - 1) %% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree) + 1
Canopy_Positions_Numeric <- ((Response_Numbers - 1) %% Number_of_Responses_per_Tree) + 1

# Great. Now, we can set all of the '1's equal to
# 'ground', all of the '2's equal to 'midcanopy',
# and all of the '3's equal to 'upper_canopy'.

(Canopy_Positions <- ifelse(Canopy_Positions_Numeric == 1, 'ground', ifelse(Canopy_Positions_Numeric == 2, 'midcanopy', 'upper_canopy')))

# how many significant digits to round to.

# 'cut'

# We wish to sort up our vector of responses
# into 'low', medium', and 'high'.

npk$yield

# 'low' yields are below 50 and 'high' yields
# are above 60.

# We could also split these yields up by terciles.

cut(npk$yield, c(Terciles[1], Terciles[2], Terciles[3], Terciles[4]), c('low', 'medium', 'high'))

# 'cut' is a little more efficient that nesting
# 'ifelse' functions when you're dealing with numeric
# data.

# What if you're working with non-numeric data?

# The 'switch' statement

# work on vectors.

y <- 1:3
switch(y, "cat", "dog", "horse")

# Though 'switch' does not work in this
# instance, we can still convert a vector
# of numbers into the desired character
# strings all at once, though. Let's turn
# our numeric vector into levels of a factor.

y <- as.factor(y)
str(y)

# We can assign names to factor levels (i.e.,
# numbers) by using the 'levels' function (as
# long as the object containing the numbers is
# of class 'factor')

levels(y) <- c("cat", "dog", "horse")
y

z <- c(1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3)
